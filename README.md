# SensRNet Collaboration Documents

This repo is a semi-private repo to support collaboration in (Markdown) documents around [SensRNet](https://kadaster-labs.github.io/sensrnet-home/). This actually should have been a repository under the [kadaster-labs](https://github.com/kadaster-labs/) organization on GitHub ... but due to rights and enterprise configuration this is not an option at the moment :(

Nonetheless this works the same and provides me the controls I need to enable collaboration on documents :muscle:

This repository documents can be edited via [HackMD.io](https://hackmd.io), a fancy site enabling writing [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) directly in the browser and sync with GitHub repos (manual action to actually sync).
